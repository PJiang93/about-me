    I am a Ph.D. Candidate (ABD) in the Department of ECE at Old Dominion University (ODU) and lecturer in the School of Cybersecurity. I am currently one of the NSA CAE POC at ODU for Cyber Defense (CAE-CD) and Cyber Operation (CAE-CO). I am advising more than 50 students in the Cyber Operation major.   
    My Ph.D. dissertation is advised by Dr. Chunsheng Xin (ODU) and co-advised by Dr. Hongyi (Michael) Wu (University of Arizona). My research interests focus on exploring and addressing the security challenges of emerging technologies such as self-driving vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and next-generation wireless (NextG) communications.   </div>
