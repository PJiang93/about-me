    I am a Lecturer in the School of Cybersecurity at Old Dominion University (ODU) in Norfolk, VA. My Ph.D. dissertation is advised by Dr. Chunsheng Xin (ODU) and co-advised by Dr. Hongyi (Michael) Wu (University of Arizona). My research interests focus on exploring and addressing the security challenges of emerging technologies such as self-driving vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), Internet of Things (IoT), and next-generation wireless communications. In addition to research, I am also committed to teaching and mentoring the next generation of cybersecurity professionals. I have taught courses on topics such as cybersecurity techniques and operaitons, and network security. Meanwhile, I am also the leadning instructor for GenCyber Summer Camp in which teach more than 200 K-12 students.
