    I am a Ph.D. Candidate (ABD) in the Department of ECE at Old Dominion University (ODU) and lecturer in the School of Cybersecurity. I am currently the Alternate POC for NSA CAE Cyber Defense (CAE-CD) and Cyber Operation (CAE-CO) at ODU. I am advising more than 50 students in the Cyber Operation major.   
    My Ph.D. dissertation is advised by <a href="https://www.odu.edu/directory/chunsheng-xin" target="_blank"><u> <b>Dr. Chunsheng Xin</b>  </u></a>  and co-advised by <a href="https://ece.engineering.arizona.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/hongyi-michael-wu" target="_blank"><u>Dr. Hongyi (Michael) Wu (University of Arizona)</u></a> . My research interests focus on exploring and addressing the security challenges of emerging technologies such as self-driving vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and next-generation wireless (NextG) communications.   </div>
